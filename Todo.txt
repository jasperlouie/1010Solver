TODO:
Major:
[x] Make moves more compact: location can be stored in a single char, so they can be represented by two chars
[x] Keep a log of moves when playing a game (so you can replay any game) 
[] make utility to save results of run as .json files, and make sure to include tags with what alg they were run with so they can be aggregated
[] make every .py file just have a dict of title:solvers, and have play.py just append those lists
[] Remake mapping portion in spark so it can be run parallelized
[] Make more heuristics, including ones involving floodfill/trying to keep things together, and just figure out a better way to score
[] Minimax/expectimax
[] Machine learning alg
[] make a script that allows it to work with an android emulator and actually play the game

For Fun:
[] improve misere strategy

Ideas:
[x] Maybe in move log, have a char that represents a col/row clear event that is not used in piece dict. that way you can undo moves and not have to copy so many boards
[] if you change board encoding to bits completely, you can use bit manips to edit it? but prob not because understandability over structure?
	have each piece in bit string format, right shift it by x+y*10 to get a spot where it will be, not and it to check if valid move, or it to get updated board. only problem is how to check cols? maybe just iterate through bits 
[] optimize valid move maker: do this by sorting by largest piece, and if others fit in it, then you can generate some of their moves based on it? also you only need to check if placeable on open spaces, so maybe keep a list of open spaces?
